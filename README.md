# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
**How to Play Tic-Tac-Toe:**

- **Objective**:  
  - Get three of your marks (either 'X' or 'Y') in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

- **Players**:  
  - 2 players: Player 1 uses 'X' and Player 2 uses 'Y'.

- **Game Board**:  
  - The game is played on a 3x3 grid with 9 empty spaces.
  - The grid is numbered from 1 to 9 to represent the spaces:
    ```
    1 | 2 | 3  
    4 | 5 | 6  
    7 | 8 | 9
    ```

- **Gameplay**:
  1. **Start the Game**:  
     - Player 1 starts by choosing any empty spot to place their mark ('X').
  2. **Turn Order**:  
     - Players alternate turns. Player 1 always goes first.
  3. **Choose a Spot**:  
     - On your turn, select an empty spot (from 1 to 9) to place your mark.
     - The game will show the board after each move.

- **Winning the Game**:
  - You win by placing three of your marks in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
  - Example of a winning line:
    ```
    X | X | X
    ```
  - If a player completes a row, column, or diagonal, they win the game.

- **Draw Condition**:
  - If all 9 spots are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a draw (no winner).

- **Important Rules**:
  - Players cannot choose an already filled spot.
  - The game continues until there is a winner or the board is full.

- **Game Over**:
  - If there’s a winner, the game announces who won (either 'X' or 'Y').
  - If there’s no winner after all spots are filled, the game announces a draw.
